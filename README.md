I recently graduated as Computer Systems Technician at George Brown College. The reason for my academic choice is my desire to pursue a professional career in computer system.
My program has enabled me to become proficient in troubleshooting computer systems and cisco devices
I acquired related skills to install and update operating systems, servers, and all the necessary experience to troubleshoot and install hardware and software for computer systems.
After successfully passing the CCNA exam, I planned to get CCNP and already booked test for AWS Solution Architect by the start of Feb 2023.
I always wanted to make myself useful. I would bring this same energy and enthusiasm to your team, and I would make an immediate impact.
